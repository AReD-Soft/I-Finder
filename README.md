Perfectworld interfaces .xml finder

How to Use : 
1. Extract all the contents of interface.pck.
2. Put it in one folder, leave it as is.
3. Look for the word you want to find, there it is located.
4. Then open the file and edit the .xml according to your language.
5. I recommend vscode or sublime for editing text in UTF-16 format with bomb code, the game only reads text in that format.
6. Done, repack the interfaces.pck again.
