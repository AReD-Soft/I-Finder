# I-Finder
Perfectworld interfaces .xml finder.

### Purposes
To manually edit the interface, change the text and language.

### How to Use : 
1. Extract all the contents of interface.pck.
2. Put it in one folder, leave it as is.
3. Look for the word you want to find, there it is located.
4. Then open the file and edit the .xml according to your language.
5. I recommend vscode or sublime for editing text in UTF-16 format with bom code, the game only reads text in that format.
6. Done, repack the interfaces.pck again.

## Language is not a limitation
